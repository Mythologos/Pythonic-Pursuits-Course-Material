    "Last time, we talked about the *bool* type--a type defined purely in two modes of True and False. We use this very basic, very simplistic type to make logical determinations about our program. These logical determinations, as we discussed, power two distinct but related fundamental constructs in programming: selection and iteration. With these constructs in hand, our programs can become massively complex, nuanced, and coordinated. However, there are many instances when True and False in and of themselves are not enough or require syntactic verbosity to represent. In such situations, we levy *Boolean logic* and its corresponding *logical operators* to determine information about our program more smoothly and elegantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bridge will have four sections. The first will discuss the major operators of Boolean logic: AND, OR, and NOT. The second, third, and fourth will then discuss other operators that can be used with Booleans or other types to make logical determinations. The second section will discuss comparison operators (greater-than, less-than, greater-than-or-equal-to, less-than-or-equal-to, equal-to, and not-equal-to). The third section will go over identity operators (*is* and *is not*). Finally, the fourth section will relate membership operators (*in* and *not in*). Examples throughout these discussions will utilize these operators to reinforce selection and iteration."

If not, we can't pet it at all in normal conditions. Second, we generally want to know the dog--we may not want to approach a dog that may be ill or hostile. Even if we know a dog, though, we want to be sure that the dog is not ill-tempered or vicious; we don't want the dog to retaliate to our kindness. Furthermore, we want to know that the dog is calm, as even a generally mild dog could harm us if it is in a bad mood. Finally, we want to be sure that the owner permits us to pet the dog; certainly, situations come up in which petting a dog may be harmful or inconvenient, such as when the dog is covered in flea medicine. With all of these conditions in place, we can set up some booleans to help us determine whetheror not to pet the dog. We could produce the following code:"
