    "When tackling a larger project, we often want to tackle it with a certain methodology in mind. We don't want to wander around blindly and get disorganized; after all, this could cause us more harm than good if we get lost in our own code and have to deal with an excessive amount of bugs. Here, we will introduce two basic ways of thinking which may help you in beginning to code larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is called **top-down design**. It begins on the abstract level, considering the larger structures with which the program needs to run before the nitty-gritty base components. It requires planning in order to be done correctly, as it has to progress from the abstract to the concrete in a structured and organized manner. However, this method assures that all components in the program are constructed to do what the abstract version of the program is intended to do. On the other hand, it can restrict testing; if the abstract version of the program is prioritized, then one must wait until the concrete parts of the program are in place to deeply examine the program's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning the first method around, the second method is called **bottom-up design**. It starts on the concrete level and proceeds to the abstract intention of the program. Unlike top-down design, this method allows for testing immediately. The base components must be built first to put the more abstract components in place. However, while this approach requires less forethought and planning, it can veer off course if the concrete base components do not align well with what the abstract level truly needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our project is small, you can use either of these strategies in order to proceed. It is unlikely that you will get completely bewildered and list in your code, as it will not likely exceed 150 lines. If you perform top-down design, you might start by planning out all of the methods that you need for the program and the functionality that it should have. Meanwhile, if you do bottom-up design, you might start by implementing menu and input functions. You might also distinctly implement the two guessing games. Finally, you would combine them to construct the whole of the system."

Here, we'll discuss a simple strategy that allows you to have full control of the debugging process without going into too much detail about debugging tools in our IDE. To do this, we can use print statements. Say we had the following code:"

Adding print statements allows us to track the program's **control flow**--in other words, the general \"path\" of the program in its execution. The only issue with using print statements is that we have to keep track of them so that we can remove them later. It is often better to add and remove them as needed; this prevents us from forgetting about print statements and leaving them in the code, causing unintended behavior to occur on occasion."

We won't get into the technical details or introduce full methdologies like in the Project Approaches section, but we will briefly mention the way in which you ought to think about testing. For each function, there are various sets of inputs and outputs that you can expect. On this basis, you can divide these inputs and outputs into distinct groups of items to test for. In other words, if your determinations about these sets are correct, then testing any one item in these sets will count for testing all of them. \n",

    "For example, if you were testing a program that converted a time in non-military time to military time, you might test times in the first twelve hours, in the second twelve hours, and innappropriate temporal values (e.g. times that don't make sense at all in non-military time, such as 13:00 P.M. or -1:00 A.M., or non-time values like 42 and \"this isn't a time\").\n",

Zero, one, and the upper limit are often good choices of numerical values for testing.
