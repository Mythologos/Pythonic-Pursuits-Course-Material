# Pythonic-Pursuits-Course-Material (v0.1.3)
 Programming is a difficult task, especially for those unaware of all of the complexities that lie within modern computing. As someone greatly interested in programming, Python, and teaching, I have wanted to construct a course that would help to guide aspiring programmers toward building functional, interesting projects. Furthermore, I have wanted to continue learning through doing; what better way is there to do so than by tackling new projects and imparting knowledge to others? Therefore, I am presently fashioning a course to this effect. I hope that it is effective not only in aiding the education of friends of mine but also others who may find these documents and projects to be useful.
 At the same time, I am also a novice educator and only a decent programmer. I will certainly make mistakes along the way and hope to learn a lot myself. Please feel free to open an issue if you feel that I have discussed some concept erroneously. Furthermore, I am glad to hear suggestions in the same way.
